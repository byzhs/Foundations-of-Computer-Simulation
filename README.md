## Taylor Series Calculation

In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. This task involves writing a program to compute sin(x) for a given value of x using the Taylor series approximation.

## Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is a form of motion in which an object or particle is thrown near the earth's surface, and it moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only. This task involves simulating projectile motion by solving equations using Euler's method and the Midpoint method.

## Pendulum Simulation
This task involves preparing a mathematical pendulum motion simulation by solving the differential equations describing the pendulum motion using the improved Euler method and RK4 method. The objective is to prepare energy graphs for potential, kinetic, and total energy and compare the results.

## Rolling Objects Simulation
This task involves simulating objects rolling on an inclined plane using the midpoint method for calculations. The simulation should be carried out for two different objects, such as a sphere and a cylinder. The results should be presented in the form of a graph of the center of mass and rotation angle, with an optional plot of potential, kinetic, and total energy.

## Moon and Earth Simulation
This task involves plotting the trajectory of the moon relative to the sun by solving the equations describing the movement of the Earth around the sun and the moon relative to the Earth. The simulation assumes that the Earth is moving in a circular orbit and uses the improved Euler method (Midpoint) for calculations.

## Wave Equation
This task involves solving the string equation, which determines the shape of the string at a given moment. The equation is approximated and solved using the Midpoint method. The goal is to determine the potential, kinetic, and total energy of the string and present these energies on a graph.

## Plate Temperature Distribution
This task involves generating a system of equations for a square plate based on a given scheme. The density of node distribution is n = 41, and the number of nodes with unknowns is 40x40. The objective is to solve the system of linear equations by any method and present the result as a graph of the temperature distribution inside the plate.

## 3D Differential Equations
This task involves solving a set of 3D differential equations using Euler, Midpoint, and RK4 methods and expressing the results as a plot of z on x. The differential equations describe the motion of a system with given initial conditions and parameters.

## Game of Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway. This task involves preparing a Game of Life simulation for a finite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells with cyclic boundary conditions. The user should be able to change rules during the game.

## Fractal Plant Simulation
This task involves implementing the L-system representing the growth of the plant (Fractal plant) for given parameters. The L-system uses specific symbols and rules to generate the fractal pattern, and the simulation involves drawing the pattern using a graphical tool.
